        <strong>Edward Joseph Snowden</strong>
            <p>Snowden was born in North Carolina, and his family moved to central Maryland, a short distance from NSA headquarters 
            at Fort Meade, when he was a child. He dropped out of high school and studied intermittently between 1999 and 2005 at a 
            community college; he completed a GED but did not receive a college degree. In 2005 he worked as a security guard at the 
            Center for Advanced Study of Language, a University of Maryland research facility affiliated with the NSA. Despite a relative 
            lack of formal education and training, Snowden demonstrated an aptitude with computers, and he was hired by the Central Intelligence 
            Agency in 2006. He was given a top secret clearance and in 2007 was posted to Geneva, where he worked as a network security technician 
            under a diplomatic cover.

            </br>
            Snowden left the CIA for the NSA in 2009. There he worked as a private contractor for the companies Dell and Booz Allen Hamilton. 
            During this time, he began gathering information on a number of NSA activities—most notably, secret surveillance programs that he 
            believed were overly broad in size and scope. In May 2013 Snowden requested a medical leave of absence and flew to Hong Kong, where 
            during the following month he conducted a series of interviews with journalists from the newspaper The Guardian</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">How Filipinos gives attribution to a ‘hero’ in the current 21st century?<br><br>
                        Despite not being a Filipino, he should be given some recognition because he prevented further US
                        government activities that involve snooping into the network and devices of every person in the world.
                        The US government does that in order to prevent terrorism and to be a step further ahead to stop those 
                        activities. However, Snowden stepped up and leaked the data and was able to deliver it to the news.

                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">How the current context of 21st century redefine the idea of a Hero?<br><br>
                        Data privacy is strictly observed. But the US government did not follow that practice and just decided to 
                        get into everyone's network just for "Security purposes". Ed Snowden is considered a hero for me because I and
                        billions of people were not aware that we are being spied on. Snowden was able to put a stop to it resulting in
                        a stop to the government activities. This also forced Snowden to make a decision but live somewhere else because 
                        he is wanted in the US.

                    <h3>Guide Question 3</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>What are the defining moments in 21st century that allowed Filipinos to idealize a ‘hero’?<br><br>
                        Since almost anything is possible with technology, being able to hack into other people's devices and leak data
                        is very much possible. Then again, Snowden leaking the information about the US government's activities made us
                        check twice if our devices are hacked. If Snowden wasn't able to stop it, then it is possible that we are being 
                        tracked as we speak.
