        <strong>ESSENTIAL WORKERS</strong>
        <p>A key worker, critical worker or essential worker is a public-sector or private-sector employee who 
        is considered to provide an essential service. During the pandemic, To contain the virus, millions of 
        people were confined to their homes, either unable to work or continuing virtually. This excludes workers 
        categorised as ‘essential’, who continued their jobs on the frontline of the pandemic. This group includes 
        workers in the health and care sector, victim support services, education, supermarkets, pharmacies and banks.</p>

                    <p>How Filipinos gives attribution to a ‘hero’ in the current 21st century?<br><br>
                        We should not take the essential workers for granted. Because of them, they were able to 
                        keep things going like normal even during the pandemic. Despite being more prone to the virus,
                        they still went to work for them to earn money and be able to help themselves and their families.

                    <br>
                    <p>How the current context of 21st century redefine the idea of a Hero?<br><br>
                        In this day and age, the essential workers are considered heroes because they stand up for
                        their families and in the context of the pandemic era, not much people can go out and earn 
                        possibly because they are sick or unvaccinated which makes them more susceptible. So they have no
                        choice but to rely on the essential workers

                    <p>What are the defining moments in 21st century that allowed Filipinos to idealize a ‘hero’?<br><br>
                        Being able to care for others and keep pushing through adversity. These are what essential workers
                        are made of. They are selfless and genuine. They might have thought of giving up but they still choose
                        to work since there are other people relying on them.
