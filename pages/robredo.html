        <strong>Leni Robredo</strong>
            <p>Robredo has also led numerous relief operations through the Office of the Vice President. The same office manages a 
            comprehensive COVID-19 response program that offers a range of assistance projects such as free transportation services 
            to frontliners, free teleconsultation services nationwide, handling logistics and manpower to transmit vaccine supply 
            from the national government task force to local government units and vaccine express sites in partnership with LGUs.
            </br>
            </br>
                Her flagship program as vice president, Angat Buhay, is an anti-poverty program providing and coordinating

                    <br>
                    <p>How Filipinos gives attribution to a ‘hero’ in the current 21st century?<br><br>
                        I am amazed by how Leni Robredo earned the trust of some Filipinos and by being humble.
                        I also admire how she manages things on a national level sometimes even international matters.
                        She is a hero for me because she, on her own volition, chose to represent the Philippines and 
                        vows to make changes.

                    <br>
                    <p>How the current context of 21st century redefine the idea of a Hero?<br><br>
                        Leni Robredo was able to provide plans that could potentially fix the current state of the Philippines.
                        Being able to formulate ideas that could solve near to impossible problems is what made me see her as a hero.

                    <br>
                    <p>What are the defining moments in 21st century that allowed Filipinos to idealize a ‘hero’?<br><br>
                        A very recent example is during the campaign period where Filipinos gathered without any bribery to support
                        Leni. She showed a character where she won't back down and help us build again the country that has fallen so much
                        Leni stood strong until then end of the campaign. And even now despite not being a government official, she still finds ways to support us.
