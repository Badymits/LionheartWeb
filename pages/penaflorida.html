        <strong>Efren Peñaflorida Jr</strong>
            <p>In 1997, one visionary young man, Efren Peñaflorida Jr., came up with an answer to the problem of educating underprivileged children. 
            He was only 16 years old when inspiration struck. Having lived in a garbage dump in his early days, He knew too well the painful trials, 
            fears, and perils of destitution. Now his Dynamic Teen Company offers an alternative to gangs through education.
            </br>
            </br>
            Peñaflorida grew up in Caridad, Cavite not having much. The middle child of a tricycle driver and a vendor, he dreamt of being an engineer. 
            He met his mentor during grade school, a pastor at Club 8586, where he volunteered to help with outreach projects. It was his mentor who also 
            encouraged him to continue with volunteer work, assuring him that the Club will help him with his education. Knowing firsthand how living in 
            the slums can push children into a life filled with drugs, violence and hopelessness, Peñaflorida formed the Dynamic Teen Company (DTC) in 1999 
            to divert the attention of students from violent gangs and fraternities.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>How Filipinos gives attribution to a ‘hero’ in the current 21st century?<br><br>
                        I consider him a hero because I believe that an educated person can make changes. One of his goals is to teach the 
                        younger generation for free and provide free education to the poor. Honestly this was one of my dreams, to teach 
                        those who are not able to afford quality education. My goals align with Efren's and I admire his works and efforts.

                    <br>
                    <p>How the current context of 21st century redefine the idea of a Hero?<br><br>
                        In the Philippines, education is not that accessible. So the solution that Efren came up with is that he taught
                        students and brought along his pushcart filled with books for the students to read. Serving other people without
                        asking for anything in return is what a hero is.

                    <br>
                    <p>What are the defining moments in 21st century that allowed Filipinos to idealize a ‘hero’?<br><br>
                        The moment that he became a hero was when he decided to teach the youth living in slum areas. He is a great example
                        of being a selfless person. Providing free education to the youth and to prevent them from joining gangs is a step
                        forward to decreasing crime in the country and an increase in more educated pinoys.
