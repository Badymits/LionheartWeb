        <strong>Miriam Defensor Santiago</strong>
            <p>She earned the degree, Doctor of Juridical Science, in the United States. Dr. Miriam Defensor Santiago is a globally 
            famous personality, because of her legal brilliance and courageous example in fighting corruption. In a nation where many 
            public officials are charged with, or suspected, of plunder, her honesty shines like a light in the darkness.
            She has brought honor to the Philippines in several ways. She is the first Filipino and the first Asian from a developing 
            country, to be elected in the United Nations as judge of the International Criminal Court. The ICC hears cases against heads of state. 
            Thus, she put the Philippines on the global map in the 21st century. Unfortunately, grave illness forced her to waive the privilege of being an ICC judge.
            </br>
            </br>
            Apart from her outstanding services abroad, Senator Santiago served in all three branches of the Philippine government.
            In the executive branch, she was the immigration commissioner who once said that she “ate death threats for breakfast.
            These came from the actions she’s taken to address the Philippines’ then reputation as “the fake passport capital of the world.” She directed raids with alien criminals, 
            syndicates, including alien pedophiles, and the Yakuza.</p>

                    <p>How Filipinos gives attribution to a ‘hero’ in the current 21st century?<br><br>
                        I consider Miriam as a hero because of her strong conviction and will to eradicate corruption
                        which is one of the primary sources on why the Philippines is not succeeding. Politicians with no 
                        intention of serving the citizens of the coutnry and having personal agendas while using the money of
                        the Filipinos should be removed from their position.

                    <p>How the current context of 21st century redefine the idea of a Hero?<br><br>
                        Senator Miriam once said that those who like her, raise their hand, and those that dislike her
                        should raise their standards. She is a hero because of her siding with justice. People should recognize
                        and acknowledge her intentions to fixing this corrupt government.

                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">What are the defining moments in 21st century that allowed Filipinos to idealize a ‘hero’?<br><br>
                        According to the rmaward asia website, also one of the defining moments that made me see her as a hero,
                        was that during the time where she was commissioner and the youngest presiding judge in the Regional Trial Court
                        QC, she handled a record fifty cases a month by refusing to tolerate delays and postponements. Resisting pressure 
                        from high officials and the military, she gained a reputation for strict impartiality in applying the law. Setting 
                        the example personally, she insisted that the employees be efficient, competent, and honest. "No bribes or extortion" 
                        was the first rule of her courtroom.
